# Themis 1.1.0

Themis 1.1.0 is focused on correctness and scale for experiment workflows.

## Highlights

- **Safer cache behavior**
  - Versioned task cache keys with reference-aware fingerprints.
  - Evaluation cache keys now always include evaluation config fingerprints.
- **Statistically honest bootstrap reporting**
  - Bootstrap mode is now CI-only (no synthetic p-values).
  - Multiple-comparison correction only runs on valid hypothesis-test p-values.
- **Better performance at large scale**
  - Generation/orchestration paths now stream work instead of pre-materializing full task lists.
  - New `max_in_flight_tasks` control for bounded in-flight scheduling.
- **Improved CLI experience**
  - `themis eval` now supports custom `.json` / `.jsonl` dataset files.
  - Results commands default to `.cache/experiments` with legacy fallback for `.cache/runs`.
- **Bounded-memory guardrails**
  - Reports now carry truncation metadata.
  - Inferential helper APIs raise clear errors when per-sample vectors are truncated.

## Why this matters

- Resume/cache is now safer when references change.
- Comparison reports are clearer and less likely to overstate significance.
- Large runs have lower memory pressure with streaming execution.
- CLI users can run custom datasets directly without dropping into Python.

## Migration notes

- Cache key formats changed in 1.1.0. Existing runs remain readable, but old keys will not produce false hits under new key formats.
- If tooling assumed `.cache/runs` as a default, switch to `.cache/experiments` or pass `--storage .cache/runs` explicitly.
