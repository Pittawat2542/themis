# Themis 1.2.1

Themis 1.2.1 focuses on making the core evaluation engines infinitely customizable by replacing the legacy string-based `ModelProvider` system with standard Python Protocol executors, alongside major documentation improvements covering the framework's design philosophy and orchestration capabilities.

## Execution Refactoring

- **TaskExecutor API**: Replaced `ModelProvider` with `StatelessTaskExecutor` and `StatefulTaskExecutor` interfaces. This unifies single-turn and multi-turn (agentic) workflows.
- You can now pass stateful python objects straight into the `GenerationRunner` or route map.

## Documentation Improvements

- Added **Philosophy Guide** detailing the core design tenets (immutability, code configuration, and progressive complexity).
- Added **Advanced Orchestration Guide** detailing how to manually instantiate `GenerationPlan`, `ProviderRouter`, `GenerationRunner`, and `EvaluationPipeline`.
