# Themis 1.1.1.post1

Themis 1.1.1.post1 is a post-release hardening update for 1.1.1.

## Highlights

- Fixed execution-metric memory-limit reporting so per-case errors are explicit and stable.
- Increased coverage for execution-metric worker paths to satisfy module coverage gates.
- Added a staged-file Ruff pre-commit guard to catch formatting/lint issues before commits.
- Updated release workflows so GitHub releases and PyPI publishing require successful `CI` on the release commit.

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking API changes.
- Existing caches and storage remain compatible with 1.1.x.

## Validation

The post-release candidate was validated with:

- `uv run pytest tests/evaluation/metrics/test_execution_metric.py -q`
- `uv run pytest -q --cov=themis --cov-report=xml --cov-report=json:coverage.json --cov-fail-under=60`
- `uv run python scripts/check_coverage_thresholds.py coverage.json`
- `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
