# Themis 1.4.0

Themis 1.4.0 introduces major architectural modularization, improved Developer Experience (DX), conditional metrics, and agentic evaluation examples.

## Key Highlights

- **Improved DX**: Overhauled cookbook, getting-started guides, and cross-reference docstrings across core modules.
- **Agentic Examples**: Added conversation paradigms and agentic evaluation examples, including research loop caching and tool auto-packing (`from_function`).
- **Modular Refactoring**: Decomposed large monolithic files (`storage`, `comparison`, `execution`, `generation`, `evaluation`, `benchmarks`, `visualization`, `conversation`, `progress`, `server`) into cohesive modular sub-components.
- **Adaptive Pipeline**: Implemented conditional metrics and an adaptive evaluation pipeline.
- **Serialization**: Replaced hand-rolled serialization logic with resilient dataclass introspection.
