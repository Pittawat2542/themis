# Themis 1.1.1

Themis 1.1.1 is a stabilization release focused on CLI reliability and
documentation correctness.

## Highlights

- Fixed a command-resolution bug that caused `themis compare --help` and some
  compare command paths to fail.
- Fixed `examples-simple/04_comparison.py` so example runs persist evaluation
  artifacts and compare consistently.
- Updated API/getting-started/CLI/server docs to match current behavior.
- Added regression tests that assert docs and CLI examples remain runnable.

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking API changes.
- Existing caches and storage remain compatible with 1.1.0.

## Validation

The release candidate was validated with:

- `uv run python -m themis.cli compare --help`
- `uv run python examples-simple/04_comparison.py`
- `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_main_compare.py tests/docs -q`
- `uv run mkdocs build --strict`
