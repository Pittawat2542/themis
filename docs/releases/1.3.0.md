# Themis 1.3.0

Themis 1.3.0 introduces a massive Developer Experience (DX) and code quality cleanup. The release focuses on unifying error handling, optimizing import performance, and making the codebase cleaner.

## Custom Exception Hierarchy
- Entire exception handling system is now structured around `ThemisError` with distinct sub-types (`ConfigurationError`, `ProviderError`, `DatasetError`, `MetricError`, `EvaluationError`, `DependencyError`). 
- Better error messages now clearly outline missing optional dependencies or list all registered components (e.g. metrics/providers) on `KeyError`.

## Performance Improvements
- Start-up time is drastically improved (to sub-50ms) by adopting lazy module loading for `themis/__init__.py` and dataset catalogs. 

## Documentation and API Formats
- Full adherence to standard Python 3.12+ type checks.
- Eradicated all remaining legacy terminology, and comprehensively verified the documentation and tutorials against the new `TaskExecutor` standard API.
