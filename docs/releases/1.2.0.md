# Themis 1.2.0

Themis 1.2.0 is a massive architectural cleanup release that removes obsolete internal concepts, hardens backwards compatibility, and dramatically simplifies the core APIs.

## Highlights
- **Architecture Simplification**: Complete removal of `MetricPipeline` and `FlexibleGenerationPlan` in favor of streamlined evaluation execution.
- **Entrypoint Consolidation**: Unified execution into the `themis.evaluate()` core function seamlessly parsing all configurations.
- **Removed Deprecations**: Strict removal of outdated datasets, cache key routines, and cost_tracking shims to eliminate code bloat.
- **Example Deduplication**: Unification of `examples/` and `examples-simple/` into a single, clean directory for new user onboarding.
